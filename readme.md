# Crossroad

## Basic idea

    With our idea of this application we tried to get the best traffic-flow
    if 4 cars come to a road.
    Each car has a direction where it wants to drive.

## Difficulties

    The main problem was to differentiate of duzens cases
    what the most efficient way is.
    Often we had the problem that e.g. the best way to handle a situation is
    to let two cars drive, but there were also two possibilities
    (when all cars want to go straight, two opposite ones can drive).

    When we discovered this problem, we introduced the "Kiwara",
    our interpretation of an efficient way to handle such problems.

## Not our business

    In the very beginning of our planning phase we found out that
    implementing all cases, even if only one, two or three cars are coming to a road,
    is way too much of programming and not our intention to do.
    So our "Kiwara" only handles cases if all roads are occupied of cars.
